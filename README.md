## Git vs. GitHub

* Git  
    * A version control system that tracks changes made to folders or files.
    * Shows users a list of changes with a message that the user gave to git  
      When users request for the change history. 
* GitHub 
    * Using git's system of version control and adding in visuals that help   
      people easily see changes. 
    * This online website allows collaboration between many programmers because programmers   
      can access each other's code and make changes that the original creator might approve.
